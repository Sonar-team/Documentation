Certainly! We can expand the table with additional parameters that are relevant to the evaluation of synchronization mechanisms:

| State                      | C Var Global   | Rust `std::sync::Mutex` | Rust `tokio::sync::Mutex` (async) | Rust FIFO (e.g., channels) |

Additional parameters explained:

- **Overhead**: This refers to the resource and performance costs associated with using the synchronization mechanism. Async mutexes tend to have higher overhead due to the complexity of the async runtime.

- **Throughput**: The rate at which work is completed. FIFO queues and async mutexes typically allow higher throughput due to non-blocking behavior and concurrent task handling.

- **Fairness**: Whether the synchronization mechanism ensures that each task gets a fair chance at execution without being starved by others.

- **Context Switch Required**: Whether the mechanism requires the operating system to perform a context switch, which is a significant performance cost. Asynchronous operations typically do not require a context switch because they are managed within the runtime at the user-space level.

- **Blocking**: Indicates whether a thread or task is put to sleep (blocked) while waiting for the resource.

- **Suitable for High Contention**: Whether the mechanism is well-suited for scenarios where there is a high degree of competition for resources.

- **Ease of Use**: The relative simplicity or difficulty of correctly implementing and using the synchronization mechanism in a concurrent programming context.
